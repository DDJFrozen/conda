Welcome to an example Binder¶
This notebook uses a Python environment with a few libraries, including dask, all of which were specificied using a conda environment.yml file. To demo the environment, we'll show a simplified example of using dask to analyze time series data, adapted from Matthew Rocklin's excellent repo of dask examples — check out that repo for the full version (and many other examples).
Setup plotting
In [1]:
%matplotlib inline
Turn on a global progress bar
In [2]:
from dask.diagnostics import ProgressBar
In [3]:
progress_bar = ProgressBar()
progress_bar.register()
Generate fake data
In [4]:
import dask.dataframe as dd
In [5]:
df = dd.demo.make_timeseries(start='2000', end='2015', dtypes={'A': float, 'B': int},
                             freq='5s', partition_freq='3M', seed=1234)
Compute and plot a cumulative sum
In [6]:
df.A.cumsum().resample('1w').mean().compute().plot();
